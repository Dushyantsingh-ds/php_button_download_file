#Downloading Files with PHP
##Normally, you don't necessarily need to use any server side scripting language like PHP to download images, zip files, pdf documents, exe files, etc. If such kind of file is stored in a public accessible folder, you can just create a hyperlink pointing to that file, and whenever a user click on the link, browser will automatically downloads that file.
